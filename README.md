# Tech Used

For this application, I used HTML, CSS, and JS. I also used randomuser.me to fetch random names. 

# How it Works

The application will randomly generate 3 names and 3 random amounts. On the right side there are options to add a user, double the money, show only millionairs, sort by richest and to calculate the entire wealth. Clicking any of these buttons will run a function that will perform what they say.
